# Yearly Reports System Documentation

## Overview

The Yearly Reports System provides comprehensive attendance, leave, and performance analytics for admin users. It generates detailed reports with export functionality in both Excel and PDF formats.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š **Report Types**

#### 1. **Individual Employee Reports**
- Detailed attendance data for each employee
- Leave history and statistics
- Punctuality scores and performance metrics
- Early/late arrival tracking
- Overall performance assessment

#### 2. **Department Summary Reports**
- Aggregated data by department
- Department-wise performance comparison
- Average attendance rates per department
- Total absent/leave days by department

#### 3. **Overall Summary Reports**
- Company-wide statistics
- Key performance indicators
- Trend analysis and insights

### ðŸ“ˆ **Key Metrics Calculated**

#### **Attendance Metrics:**
- **Present Days**: Total days employee was present
- **Absent Days**: Total days employee was absent
- **Late Days**: Days employee arrived late
- **Attendance Rate**: Percentage of working days present
- **Total Working Hours**: Sum of all working hours

#### **Leave Metrics:**
- **Total Leave Days**: Sum of all approved leave days
- **Leave Applications**: Number of leave requests
- **Leave by Type**: Breakdown by leave categories

#### **Punctuality Metrics:**
- **Total Late Minutes**: Cumulative late arrival time
- **Total Early Minutes**: Cumulative early departure time
- **Punctuality Score**: Calculated score out of 100
- **Late/Early Days**: Count of days with late/early arrivals

#### **Performance Assessment:**
- **Overall Performance**: Categorized as Excellent, Good, Average, Below Average, or Poor
- **Performance Score**: Weighted calculation based on attendance, punctuality, and absence rates

### ðŸŽ¯ **Performance Scoring Algorithm**

#### **Punctuality Score Calculation:**
```
Base Score: 100
Late Penalty: min(total_late_minutes * 0.1, 50)
Early Penalty: min(total_early_minutes * 0.05, 25)
Final Score: max(0, 100 - late_penalty - early_penalty)
```

#### **Overall Performance Calculation:**
```
Overall Score = (Attendance Rate * 0.4) + (Punctuality Score * 0.3) + ((100 - Absent Rate) * 0.3)

Performance Categories:
- 90+ : Excellent
- 80-89: Good
- 70-79: Average
- 60-69: Below Average
- <60  : Poor
```
